A Non-Normal Life 

By: "The Gang"
========================================================

In the beginning, there was probability. Well, there probably was. There were all sorts of distributions of all different sorts, and it was wonderful.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(plyr)
```

Until one day, a new distribution appeared... and ABnormal distribution

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
rabnorm <- function(n, mean = 0, sd = 1, useless = "0xFFFFFF") {
    return(rcauchy(n) %% as.numeric(useless))
}
qplot(rabnorm(800), geom = "histogram")
```

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
`(` = function(x) {
  return(x*runif(1)*rgamma(1,1,1))
}

for(i in 1:5) {
  print(5 * (3+4))
}
```

Who needs to be normal anyways???? If everyone was normal there would have never been
