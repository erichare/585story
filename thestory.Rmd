A Non-Normal Life 

By: "The Gang"
========================================================

In the beginning, there was probability. Well, there probably was. There were all sorts of distributions of all different sorts, and it was wonderful.

![IT WAS GLORIOUS](http://i.imgur.com/FVXGtV0.png)

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(plyr)
```

=======
All of the distributions lived in perfect harmony.

Until one day, a new distribution appeared... and ABnormal distribution
![NOOOOO!!!!](http://i.imgur.com/OVe8D.jpg)


```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
rabnorm <- function(n, mean = 0, sd = 1, useless = "0xFFFFFF") {
    return(rcauchy(n) %% as.numeric(useless))
}
qplot(rabnorm(800), geom = "histogram")
```

![Trap](http://cccpwned.com/img/ackbar.jpg)

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
abnormal_land = function() {
  '(' = function(x) {
    return(5*x)
  }
}
```
