========================================================

In the beginning, there was probability. Well, there probably was. There were all sorts of distributions of all different sorts, and it was wonderful.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
```


```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
rabnorm <- function(n, mean = 0, sd = 1, useless = "0xFFFFFF") {
    return(rcauchy(n) %% as.numeric(useless))
}
qplot(rabnorm(500), geom = "histogram")
```


```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r fig.width=7, fig.height=6}
plot(cars)
```
